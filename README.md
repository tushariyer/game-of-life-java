# game-of-life-java
The purpose of this program is to run a simple model of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in which the game is played on a 30X30 2D array grid. Each cell can be either alive or dead, and this status is determined by the amount of neighbors present for each cell. The program randomly generates the first generation, and then runs calculations from there to determine the outcome of future generations.

This was done as a Java project for a computing fundamentals class. Unfortunately, the package is a BlueJ package, so you'll need to extract the files and then run them after you create a new project in Netbeans/Eclipse or whatever java sdk interface you prefer. I will build it soon so that you can just run the .jar file.
