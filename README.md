# game-of-life-java
The purpose of this program is to run a simple model of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in which the game is played on a 30X30 2D array grid. Each cell can be either alive or dead, and this status is determined by the amount of neighbors present for each cell. The program randomly generates the first generation, and then runs calculations from there to determine the outcome of future generations.
